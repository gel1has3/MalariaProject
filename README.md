About Malaria

• Only 60 of the 450 known species of Anopheles mosquito transmit malaria.

• The genetic diversity of these 60 mosquitoes with respect to the other 390 non- transmitters suggests that the capacity to transmit malaria was acquired independently for each species through a process of convergent evolution.

•Despite a complex process of species, co-evolution of Plasmodium parasites and corresponding Anopheles mosquitoes, some interactions are believed to be conserved across all parasite-mosquito combinations that support malaria transmission


Biology and Medicine are rapidly becoming data intensive. A recent comparison of genomics with social data, online videos and other data intensive discipline suggests that genomics alone will equal or surpass other fields in data generation and analysis within the next decade.

• A Sreenivasamurthy et al. 5 have compiled a list of 94 genes distilled from 55 publications.

• Each gene has been experimentally verified to affect Anopheles gambiae-Plasmodium interactions at various stages of Plasmodium’s lifecyle in Anopheles gambiae, as measured by number of surviving oocysts, rate of ookinetes melanization and number of sporozoites.

• 16 Anopheles species each of which has been classified as either a major or a minor/non-
vector for malaria.
